Everyone knew Lisp was doomed a few years back. Then Clojure came along and
changed the rules, renewing the interest in Lisp in an industry context.

zepto never believed in that truism to begin with. A small, Scheme-like
language with clear-cut goals and great ambitions, it has been eating most
of our free time and some of our hair for the larger part of the last two
years. Now the project, while far from being complete, has reached a point
where we want to present it to a larger audience, in the hope that this
steps instills a dialogue and maybe even provides inspiration for some
of the attendees of how they would like programming to look and feel.

We've released version 0.9.6 - the first stable version - a few weeks back,
and we want you to celebrate with us! Come many and merry, for we are very
much looking forward to introduce you into the world we have created.
